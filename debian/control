Package: libmvsim
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Multi vehicle efficient dynamics simulator - libraries
 Lightweight, realistic dynamical simulator for 2D ("2.5D") vehicles and robots.
 It is tailored to analysis of vehicle dynamics, wheel-ground contact forces
 and accurate simulation of typical robot sensors (e.g. laser scanners).
 .
 This package contains the C++ library itself.

About
======
Lightweight, realistic dynamical simulator for 2D ("2.5D") vehicles and robots.
It is tailored to analysis of vehicle dynamics, wheel-ground contact forces and
accurate simulation of typical robot sensors (e.g. laser scanners).

This project includes a C++ library `mvsim`, a standalone app, and a ROS1 node.

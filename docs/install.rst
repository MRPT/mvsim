Installing
===========

Build from sources
----------------------

Dependencies:

- A decent C++17 compiler.
- CMake >= 3.1
- MRPT (>=2.0.0): In Windows, build from sources or install precompiled binaries.
- Box2D: Will use an embedded copy if no system version is found.

In Ubuntu, this will install all requirements:

.. code-block:: bash

 sudo apt install \
   build-essential cmake g++ \
   libbox2d-dev \
   libmrpt-opengl-dev libmrpt-obs-dev libmrpt-maps-dev \
   libmrpt-gui-dev libmrpt-tfest-dev \
   protobuf-compiler \
   libzmq3-dev \
   pybind11-dev \
   libprotobuf-dev \
   libpython3-dev 


Compile as usual:

.. code-block:: bash

 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make
 #make test


ROS: Compiling & usage
------------------------

Either install as a precompiled package:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-mvsim

Or build from sources, by cloning into a catkin workspace and build as usual.

Usage: See docs and tutorials in https://wiki.ros.org/mvsim
